ВОПРОС #1:
  Вопрос: What is Jupyter?

  ОТВЕТ:
  Jupyter is a free and open-source software environment for creating,
  collaborating on, and reusing interactive data analysis notebooks. It is
  designed to make it easy to create and share interactive data visualizations,
  code, and text, and to collaborate with others in real-time. Jupyter is based
  on the Jupyter Notebook, which is a web-based text and code editor that
  integrates with a variety of front-end tools, such as JupyterLab and the
  JupyterHub server. Jupyter is used in various scientific fields, such as
  data science, machine learning, and computational biology, to facilitate the
  collaborative and interactive exploration of large datasets. It has become a
  standard tool for data science, and its popularity has led to the development
  of a wide range of extensions and add-ons that further enhance its capabilities.

ВОПРОС #2:
  Вопрос: What's new in physics science explorations?

  ОТВЕТ:
  1. Modern material science has been revolutionized by the discovery of novel
  topological states of quantum matter, which sheds new lights on solving long-standing scientific challenges.
  2. Review of prospects for discovery of new physics signals at LEP2. The areas covered include SUSY, exotic fermions, BESS models, leptoquarks, virtual effects and CP violating observables.
  3. Searches for physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics are performed at accelerators worldwide. Although having poorer detection capabilities and large beam uncertainties, ultra high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) experiments present a unique opportunity to look for new physics far beyond the TeV.
  4. A brief survey is presented of new science that will emerge during the decades ahead from direct detection of gravitational radiation. Interferometers on earth and in space will probe the universe in an entirely new way by directly sensing motions of distant matter over a range of more than a million in frequency.
  5. The status of tests of the standard electroweak model and of searches for new physics in allowed nuclear $\beta$ decay and neutron decay is reviewed including both theoretical and experimental developments. The sensitivity and complementarity of recent and ongoing experiments are discussed with emphasis on their potential to look for new physics.

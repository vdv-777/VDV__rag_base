It is\ndesigned to make it easy to create and share interactive data visualizations,\ncode, and text, and to collaborate with others in real-time. Jupyter is based\non the Jupyter Notebook, which is a web-based text and code editor that\nintegrates with a variety of front-end tools, such as JupyterLab and the\nJupyterHub server. Jupyter is used in various scientific fields, such as\ndata science, machine learning, and computational biology, to facilitate the\ncollaborative and interactive exploration of large datasets. It has become a\nstandard tool for data science, and its popularity has led to the development\nof a wide range of extensions and add-ons that further enhance its capabilities.",
